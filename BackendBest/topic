Purpose:
To prevent NoSQL injection attacks.
Explanation:
NoSQL injection is a type of attack where malicious users can inject data into MongoDB queries to manipulate their behavior. Attackers typically attempt to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data by sending specially crafted input.

const maliciousInput = { $gt: "" };
// MongoDB query:
db.users.find({ username: maliciousInput });
// The query now returns all users because `$gt: ""` is always true.
